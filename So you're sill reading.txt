I don't know if I should be flattered or worried that you're still reading my entries
Like, I'm not that interesting
On one hand, I'm flattered you think I am enough to still be reading
On the other, I'm worried about how unexciting the things that interest you might be
You know, there are some people I don't want finding me interesting 
If your idea of a good pasttime is crocheting sweaters, filing taxes, or like watching paint dry
I DO NOT want you finding me interesting. Cause then, what does that say about me? :(
What do you do, go on your schedule like: Let's see, Saturday night I'll: 
Watch the new kitchen paint dry from 11am - 5pm, 5 - 7pm watch the clouds pass by, and oh Ayo's performing at 7pm. Can't miss that

Trying this out, might take it out later:
I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm just kinda weird. Like, I'm not weird. I'm KINDA weird. 
Saying I was weird would be giving myself too much credit, I would be saying that I know what I am.
I don't
I'm not normal, oh far from it
But I'm not weird either, I'm somewhere in between
