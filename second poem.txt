Here's yet another poem
but a bit more, how you say, unhinged
in here an amateur to no good poet
a growing writer,
indulges in what too many call no good language
fuck, dick, ass, why are these bad
how are they?
how is any word bad?
when all are merely made up to communicate
is it not what we actually communicate that can be deemed good or bad?
if I were to say to you fuck you, and we both laughed,
an expression of joy, as you surprised me with something I love,
how is that bad?
on the otherside, if I reached within me and all I saw for someone was hate
and I said, frick you!! 
how is frick any better than fuck?
how is frick acceptable?
when what it's conveying is far more heinous than what fuck just conveyed?
i think that is the only thing that can be deemed wrong/right,
the impact they hold. not the words them self
so fuck!
fuck!
thanks for reading, my motherfucker
have a wonderful-ass day
i fucking love you!!
